# Bluetooth-Controlled-Car
A small 6 inch x 3 inch x 2.5 inch car controlled through a bluetooth module and a phone application.

Uses an Arduino Uno as well as an Arduino bluetooth module.
Had a manual switch to reverse the direction of motion however, that has since been changed and now contains a self implemented H-bridge.
The gears and mechanical side of the car were all hand-built including the steering mechanism. 

Bluetooth and application implementation is still in progress. Currently working on being able to crontrol the steering mechanism electronically.
